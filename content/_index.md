Hi

{{<alignleft>}}My name is Filipe Nascimento and this is my personal website :) 


I'm a Computer Scientist with an old passion for Computer Graphics. My experience includes the design/implementation of **fluid solvers**, **real-time rendering** techniques, **geometric processing**, spatial data structures, and **physically based animation** research.

I use this website as a portfolio, but also to share my knowledge and ideas. Hopefully, the content might help. Of course, any suggestions, comments, and opinions are very welcome. **Thanks for reading!**

Currently, my main repositories are:

- [hermes](https://filipecn.github.io/hermes/) - A multi-purpose library written in `C++`/`CUDA` 
- [circe](https://filipecn.github.io/circe/) - A minimalist framework for `OpenGL` (and `Vulkan`) based applications.

**Here are some general topics I work with:**
